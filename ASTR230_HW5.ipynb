    "For this problem, you will create simulated maps of 48 craters on a planetary surface.  To make these maps, you will make extensive use of a python routine called np.random.uniform().  It will randomly pick numbers between some low and high values you provide.  For example, to randomly pick 10 numbers between 1 and 5, you would say x=np.random.uniform(low=1, high=5, size=10).  You will use this random number generator to place craters on an 8 element wide by 6 element high grid, and then plot those craters by plotting a circle at each (x,y) position you generated.  "
